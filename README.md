# Next-Generation Data Access: Natural Language Interfaces for Tabular Data Querying and Visualization

This repository contains materials and resources for understanding the recent research progress on natural language interfaces for data analysis and visualization.

## Overview

Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) are revolutionizing how users interact with data by enabling intuitive, conversation-like queries instead of formal query languages. This tutorial covers state-of-the-art recent research progress on five dimensions:
- Background and problem formulation
- Benchmark datasets 
- Modeling approaches 
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Real-world systems
